# Clap-LED
contains the working arduino UNO code for a Clap Actuated LED Switch

This Mini Project was made to be evaluated for my Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Lab Course, and it turned out pretty well. 

It's a simple enough project, but the more deeper you go the more you can learn the intricacies of the Arduino itself.
